Revision history for module Win32::RunAsAdmin

0.02 2014-05-05

 - Switch to Devel::PL_origargv to obtain the command line
   *before* Perl has its way with it (per rt#95078)
 - Save the argv before anybody else gets to play with it, too, and
   update documentation to warn about this (e.g. use Win32::RunAsAdmin
   before use Getopt::Euclid, or you'll regret it!)
 - Switch to Win32::IsAdminUser (per rt#95077)
